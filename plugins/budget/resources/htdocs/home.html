      Being in control of your money is most often about having a good understanding of your income and expenses, while making provision for the unexpected moments in life when an unplanned event happens for which you need money, or for the expenses that occur less frequently. Most people not only need a budget, but also a cash flow view for a year.
    <p>
    There are many ways our mentors may be able to help you:
    <ul>
      <li> Preparing budgets and cash flow forecast.
      <li> Advice on debt consolidation and debt repayment relief.
      <li> Finding allowances and/or benefits you may not be aware are available.
      <li> Assisting with hardship applications.
      <li> Even advising on debt write off.
    </ul>
    Our service can assist you in these matters and everything is <em>confidential</em>.<br/>
