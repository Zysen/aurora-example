<h1>Welcome to your new Web Application</h1>
<p>
	This application is built using a web application framework called <a href="https://github.com/Zysen/Aurora/">Aurora</a>.
	This provides a build/compilation system with modular plugins. Default plugins are provided for various things like HTTP handling or Client side widgets. Widgets are used to put dynamic data on html pages and data access is handled via a simple publish/subscribe system and websockets. You can find out more over at <a href="/docs#aurora">/docs#aurora</a>
</p>
<p>
	Closure compiler is used for code quality as well as production obfuscation.
</p>
<p>
	This application gets its state management engine and many functional widgets from the <a href="https://github.com/evaks/recoil/">Recoil</a> project.
	Recoil is a Funcational Reactive Programming (FRP) engine for Javascript. It comes with a library of widgets that are suitable for use with functional programming.
	FRP is useful as it solves issues with the observer pattern and allows the programmer to express logic without considering how data was obtained, or considering time.
